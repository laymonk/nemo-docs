Broadcast Messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Coordinators may want to broadcast messages to observer teams in the
field in the instance of a change of polling location, schedule, or
another event. Administrators and coordinators can send Broadcasts via
email or SMS to individual users or all active users on a mission.

Please note that you need an ELMO SMS gateway with SMS credit
established before messages can be sent.

To send a Broadcast Message:

1. Click the **Users** menu
2. Select the user(s) to receive a message by marking the boxes next to
   their name(s)

       **NOTE:** Observers **do NOT** have the ability to reply to
       broadcast messages – instruct observers to contact the observer
       coordinator directly if they need to discuss a broadcast message
       or other issue.

   the medium of the broadcast can be selected, and the subject and its
