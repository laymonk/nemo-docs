Option Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Option Sets page is where the answers for Select One (ex. “What
color is your shirt?”) and Select Multiple (ex. “What kinds of food do
you like?”) question types can be created. Click the **Option Sets**
menu on the main menu bar to create or edit existing Option Sets.

Create New Option Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click **Create New Option** **Set** link available from the
   **Option Sets** menu. Option set settings appear:
   |new option set edited|
2. In the box marked **Name**, create a unique name that summarizes the Option Set being created. Observer users will not be able to view this name.

3. If this Option Set represents geographic information, check the box
   labeled **Is Geographic?** (i.e. a set of provinces or regions).
   Responses that are geographic can also appear on the map in the
   Dashboard, even if SMS-based.

   1. If the options contain coordinates, check the box labeled **With
      Coordinates?**

4. If this Option Set needs multiple levels, check the box labeled **Is
   Multilevel?** (i.e. example that is non-geographic like the example
   below?). See more information on Multilevel sets below.

   1. Click **add level** to add a level
   2. Type the name of the level (i.e. province or region)
   3. Click **Save**

5. Enter the different options for the option set in the box labeled
   **Options**
6. In the Options box, add existing options by typing them and clicking
   **Add**. If an option in the drop down menu is not visible, add a
   new one by clicking **Create New** **Option**

   1. The **Options** box allows multiple options to be typed at
      once and added or created together by separating option names by
      commas. Conclude by clicking **Add**

7. Click **Save**

**Multilevel option sets.** Checking the **Is Multilevel?** box allows
for the use of hierarchically organized options. For example, if the
question is *Where do you live?*, you may want to allow for the
selection of a certain Country (a level) that always contains a set
number of Provinces or States (another level) which have certain Cities
within each (one more level):

Country: United States-> Province/State: Georgia-> City: Atlanta or

Country: Democratic Republic of Congo -> Province/State:Nord-Kivu ->
City: Goma

At this time, Multilevel Option Sets can only be used for Select One
type questions.

To create a Multilevel Option Set:

1. Check the box labeled **Is Multilevel?**
2. Click **Add Level**
3. Type the name of the level and click **Save**
4. Repeat step 3 until all levels have been created
5. Click and drag levels so that the first level is at the top and the
   last level is at the bottom.
6. Add options
7. Click and drag options so that options of any level below the first
   are beneath and indented to the right of the options of the level
   they are within.
8. Click **Save**

In the above example, Species is the first level of the hierarchy and
Role is the second. Human, Dog, and Cat are options of Species, and Mom,
Dad, Brother, and Sister are options of Role. Note that Dog and Cat do
not have options on the Role level. Also note that when using a Tablet,
the user must first choose an option at the Species level before swiping
to the next page to view the available options at the Role level.

Option Sets can also be created with spreadsheet software, like Excel,
and uploaded directly into ELMO:

1. Outside of ELMO, create a CSV or XLS file
2. In the first row, include the name for each level as an individual
   column header(e.g. Company \| Department \| Name ).
3. Add the names of the options
    |excel option set|
4. In ELMO, click on the **Option Set** menu
5. Click **Import New Option Set**
6. Create a Name for the option set
7. Choose the CSV or XLS file created in steps 1-3
8. Click **Import**
9. If the option set is really large, the upload may be sent to
   **Operations Panel**. You will be able to work on other tasks while
   the upload continues in the background. You can also click on the
   **Operations** link to check if your upload was successful

Edit Existing Option Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click the **Option Sets** menu
2. Click the Option Set requiring editing by selecting the corresponding
   **Pencil icon**
3. Click **Save**

Note that if you wish to edit a large option set imported via CSV or XLS
file, you cannot directly edit the options in ELMO. You will need to
edit the original file and import it again. The edited file should be
imported under a different name, as importing it under the same name
will create another option set with the same name, which could lead to
confusion. For example, if an option set was imported and named LOS, the
edited option set should be imported under the name LOS #2 or something
similar, because naming it LOS will result in a second option set named
LOS being created, not the replacement of the first one.

Import Standard Option Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click **Import Standard Option Sets**
2. Click the boxes next to the option sets to be imported
3. Click **Import**

Importing Large Option Sets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Click **Import New Option Set**
2. Type a name for your option set in the box
3. Click **Choose File**
4. Select an XLS or CSV file
5. Click **Import**

Upload a Large Geographic Option Set
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To upload a large geographic option set:

1. Outside of ELMO, create a CSV or XLS file
2. In the first row, include the name for each level as an individual
   column header with “Coordinates” as the last column (e.g. Province \|
   City \| District \| Coordinates )
3. Add the name for each level
4. In the column for “Coordinates,” include both latitude and longitude
   in decimal format separated by a comma (e.g. 0.054396, 18.259688)

    | **NOTE**: To find latitude and longitude coordinates in decimal format:
    | In Google Maps:
    | 1. Open Google Maps
    | 2. Right-click the place or area on the map
    | 3. Select **What’s here?**
    | 4. A card appears at the bottom of the screen with more info
    | In  ArcGIS: **Please view Appendix**


Example:

Country   \| State  \| City       \| Coordinates

USA        \| GA     \| Atlanta  \| 33.747082, -84.380101

Language Translations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Options within an Option Set can be translated in a manner similar to
translating questions. To translate an option:
