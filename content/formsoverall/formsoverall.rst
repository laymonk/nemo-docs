Forms

Overall Structure of Forms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forms, Questions, and Option Sets can all be standardized in ELMO.
Standard Forms, Questions, and Option Sets eliminate the need for
observation groups to remake checklists for every mission, and allows
users to compare findings across missions. While election administration
is largely similar from country to country, specific regulations can
vary by country, and so should the design of the form, the questions in
it, and the answers available. ELMO allows for customized design of
forms for the mission at hand.

Standardization in ELMO Forms is a major aspect of The Carter Center’s
overall `Democratic Election Standards
project <http://electionstandards.cartercenter.org/>`__. The project
aims to build consensus on obligations for democratic elections and on
detailed criteria for assessment by advancing the evolution of standards
for democratic elections and increasing shared knowledge on election
integrity, election observation, and democracy promotion. To do so, the
project uses a `framework of
obligations <https://eos.cartercenter.org/>`__ derived from public
international law, collaborates with the international elections
community, and develops practical tools – like ELMO – for observers to
assess elections. Standard Forms, Questions, and Option Sets not only
allow for ease of mission development, but also are used by The Carter
Center to increase coordination between the international elections
community and human rights mechanisms, providing capacity-building on
international obligations to civil society groups, build consensus on
common indicators for election quality with the academic community,
measure the impact of election observation, and maintain and develop
shared knowledge on observation methodology.

Building a new form involves the following steps:

1. Creating a new form
2. Creating questions for the form
3. Depending on the question type, creating option sets for those
   question

In ELMO, these steps can be done in any order. In addition, forms,
questions, and option sets can be reused both within a mission and
across missions, depending on whether they are created in Mission Mode
or Admin Mode. They can also be edited at any time.

Forms Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Forms** menu lists all the available forms for a mission. These
are the components:\ |forms tab edited|

.. figure:: forms-tab-edited-inset.png
   :alt: forms tab edited inset


1. **Create New Form**: click this to create a new form
2. **SMS Test Console**: click this to test form submission via SMS
3. **Import Standard Forms**: click this to import standard forms to
   the mission; these forms can be edited within the mission

Once a form has been created, these components appear on the **Forms**
menu

4.  **Version**: this column shows the version numbers of the forms
    that have been published
5.  **Name**: this column shows the name of each form
6.  **Questions**: this column shows the number of questions in each
    form
7.  **Published?**: this column displays a **Yes** if a form has
    been published, and a **No** if it has not been published
8.  **Downloads**: this column shows the number of times each form has
    been downloaded
9. **Responses**: this column shows the number of responses to each
    form that have been submitted
10. **SMSable**?: this column displays a **Yes** if a form can be
    submitted via SMS, and a **No** if it cannot be submitted via SMS
11. **Allow Incomplete?**: this column displays a **Yes** if a form
    allows incomplete submissions, and a **No** if it does not allow
    incomplete submissions
12. **Last Modified**: this column shows the date and the time that
    each form was last edited
13. The **Edit** icon: click this to edit the form in this row
14. The **Delete** icon: click this to delete the form in this row;
    this can only be done for forms that are unpublished

Importing Standard Forms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forms used on different missions often contain similar or even identical
questions. In ELMO’s Admin Mode, administrator-level users can create
standard forms, questions, and option sets that remain stored in the
ELMO system and can be imported into any mission. The option to import
standard forms eliminates the need to create new forms for every
mission. Standard forms also allow for an easier comparison of data
across missions. Mission staff should import the standard versions of
option sets, questions, and forms that are not country specific and are
used repeatedly, such as the question “How many ballots were spoiled?”
or the Option Set “Yes/No/N/A/Didn’t observe.”

To import a Standard Form:

1. Go to the **Forms** menu in the mission
2. Click **Import Standard Forms**
3. Choose Forms to import to the mission

    **NOTE**: Remember to select Admin Mode to create standard forms.
    If the Admin Mode link does not appear on the screen, permission is
    not granted to create standard forms. ELMO Administrators can create
    and edit standard forms, standard questions, and standard option
    sets with the same actions used for general forms, questions, and
    option sets, but these actions must be performed in Admin Mode.

Creating a General Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Forms are composed of *questions*. Some questions require users to
select from a set of previously-defined responses (multiple choice,
yes/no, etc.), while others require the user to enter text or numeric
values. Building a new form involves the following steps: creating a new
form; creating questions for the form; and depending on the user’s
needs, creating option sets for those questions. In ELMO, these steps
can be done in any order.

1. To create a new Form:

    1. Go to the Forms page by clicking on the **Forms** menu on the main
       menu bar
    2. Click the **Create Form** link located under the Page title

       1. Give the form a name.

       That’s all you have to do, but if you want to do more, click **More
       Settings**:

       2. Check the **SMSable** box if you want to be able to receive
          responses to the form via SMS
       3. Check the **Allow Incomplete** box to allow forms to be
          submitted without required questions filled in. This is not
          typically desired, but an option if necessary

    3. Click **Save**

2. To add questions to the Form:

    1. Return to the Forms page
    2. Click the **Pencil icon** located on the same line as the desired
       form
    3. Click the **Add Questions** icon:

       1. Select from existing questions in the question bank
       2. Create a new question to add to the Form (see *Questions* section
          below for detailed instructions)

    4. Click **Save** when finished editing

Creating Groups and Grids
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A new feature in ELMO 5.x is the ability to create and sort groups of
questions. Groups, in essence, keep questions together so that they
appear on the same page. This feature serves several purposes,
including:

1. Making it easier for administrators to create and sort questions
   within forms.
2. Making it easier for users to fill out forms by:

   1. placing multiple questions on one page, thereby reducing the
      number of times a person has to swipe, and
   2. creating “grids” with Select One questions (see below), to make it
      easier to answer related questions at once.

Here is an example of a few groups:

.. figure:: Group-Example.jpg
   :alt: Group Example

Note that questions do not have to be part of a group, nor does a group
have to consist of multiple questions. A group can have one question or
no questions, but this would make the group redundant.

Groups have some restrictions:

1. Groups cannot be placed within questions or other groups.
2. Groups cannot be made conditional or hold both `conditional
   questions <../formsquestions/formsquestions.html>`__ and the
   questions that trigger them.

To create a form with groups:

.. figure:: To-create-a-group-instructions-edited.png
   :alt: To create a group instructions edited


1. Create a form
2. Create or add questions to the form
3. Create at least one group

   1. Click **Add Group**
   2. Give the group a unique name
   3. Click **Save**

4. Click and drag the questions in the desired order of appearance, with
   the first question on top and the last one on the bottom
5. Repeat step 4 for the groups. Groups must be placed directly above
   the first question that is intended to appear within that group
6. Drag questions intended for groups to the right so that they appear
   indented in relation to the group. If a question is intended to
   appear by itself, do not drag it right; leave it where it is
7. Click **Save** to save the form, or click **Save and Publish** if
   the form is ready to be used

Groups can be used to create grids, an example of which is shown below.

.. figure:: Screenshot_2016-03-15-10-23-18.png
   :alt: Screenshot\_2016-03-15-10-23-18

Grids can only be created under certain conditions:

1. Questions must be in the same group.
2. Questions must be “Select One” questions.
3. Questions must have the same option set.

To create a grid:

1. Create a form.
2. Create a group.
3. Place “Select One” questions with the same option set in the group.
4. Click **Save** to save the form, or click **Save and Publish** if
   the form is ready to be used.

Creating a Standard Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The process of creating a Standard Form is similar to that of creating a
General Form. To create a Standard Form:

1. Click **Admin Mode**
2. Click the **Forms** menu
3. Click **Create New Form**
4. Type a name for the form in the text box next to **Name**
5. Click **Save**
    |create standard form edited|
6. Click **Add Questions** to add questions to the form
7. Click **Add Groups** to add groups to the form
8. Click **Save**
    |standard form add questions edited|

Publishing a Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once a form has been created, it must be published before it can be
accessed by observers, completed, and submitted. To publish a form:

1. Click the **Forms** menu in the main menu bar
2. Select the form in the list that appears on the page
3. On the right side of the page, click the upward-pointing arrow
   located on the same line as the form to publish

.. figure:: publish-forms-edited.png
   :alt: publish forms edited

Printing Forms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

ELMO allows for forms and data to be printed. In the field, a hardcopy
of forms, particularly the SMS Composition Guide, are required by
observers in order to report. Note that you may have to turn on
background printing in your browser.

To print:

1. In either Admin or Mission Mode, click the **Forms** menu
2. Click on the form to print
3. Click **Print Form** (shown below)
