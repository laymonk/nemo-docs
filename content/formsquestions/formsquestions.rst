5. Forms: Questions
===================

To create and import questions to a mission, navigate to the Questions
page by clicking on the **Questions** menu on the main menu bar.

    **Note:** When creating a new question within the form, there are
    three options for questions available: conditional, hidden and
    required. Each of these options affects how the form is filled out
    by the user in the field. A question can be:

    -  *Conditional: whether or not it appears in the form is dependent
       upon how a previous question is answered*
    -  *Hidden: it is not shown on the form – only to be used if it
       cannot be deleted*
    -  *Required: it must be answered in order to submit the completed
       form, unless an override code is provided*

-  4: After selecting the type of question (and option set if
   applicable), enter the main text of the question in the title box

A note on image, video, or audio submissions: those files can be big!
Big files may also mean a lot of data costs as well. Consult with your
ELMO or database administrator on best practices for your project.

5.3. Creating Hints
-------------------

-  5: Add further instructions in the **Hint** box below the
   **Title** box (i.e.: for a Select Multiple question, add “Select
   all that apply” in the **Hint** box)

.. figure:: hints.png
   :alt: hints


-  6: Below the Hint box, there is an option to make the question a
   **Key Question**. This option allows responses to the form to be
   organized based on the response to the question. If this box is
   marked, a column showing these answers will be added in the Responses
   tab.
-  7: Click **Save** to generate the question
-  8: To edit the question, return to the Questions page and select the
   corresponding **Pencil icon**

5.4. Language translations
--------------------------

Question titles and hints can be translated into any language that has
been set for the mission. To add a language to a mission, go to the
**Preferred Languages** box in the **Settings** menu. When
creating or editing questions, the **Title** box will appear for the
first language in **Preferred Languages**, followed by the **Hint**
box in that language, then the **Title** and **Hint** boxes for the
second language, and so on. So, a **Preferred Languages** box that
looks like this:

.. figure:: preferred-languages-enfr.png
   :alt: preferred languages enfr


Results in this:

.. figure:: title-hint-enfr.png
   :alt: title hint enfr


To translate a title or a hint, type the translation in the
corresponding box and click **Save**. To view the translation, change
the language by clicking **Change Language** in the footer. Questions
that have been translated into the selected language will appear
translated once that language is selected. For example, the French
translation of an English question will appear once French is selected.

5.5. Tags
---------

Tags are an easy way to organize information around a common keyword or
theme. In ELMO, questions may be “tagged” with keywords or descriptors,
which may be used to find all of the questions with the same tag. Tags
are also used in Reports to help sort information assigned to questions.

.. figure:: tags.png
   :alt: tags


To tag questions:

1. Open or create the question you wish to tag.
2. Type in the **Tags** box. (You may add multiple tags.)
3. Click **Enter** to add a tag.
4. To delete a tag, click on the **X** next to the tag.
5. Click **Save** after adding tags to save your changes.
