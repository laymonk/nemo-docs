Missions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ELMO allows administrators to organize
field projects into areas called *missions*. For example, if you have a
project going on in two different countries, with different reporters or
observers, you may want to have two different missions: Country 1 and
Country 2.

Create a Mission (Admin only)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only administrators are able to work in ELMO in Mission Mode or Admin
Mode with an overall view of all missions; everyone else must be
assigned to a unique Mission. To create a mission, the Admin Mode must
be activated. To activate Admin Mode, click the *Admin Mode* menu
located in the top right corner of the screen. To create a mission:

1. Click the **Missions** menu located on the main menu bar at the top
   of the Admin Mode page
2. Once on the Missions page, click the orange **Create Mission** link
3. Enter a name for the mission: use only letters, numbers, and spaces

   1. Mission names usually include the country name and the year (i.e.
      Kenya 2013)
   2. Administrators have the option to lock a mission. When a mission
      is locked, Responses and Forms cannot be created or edited, and
      users cannot be added or deleted. To lock a mission, click the box
      labeled “\ **Locked?**\ “
   3. Click the **Save** button to save changes

4. Click **Exit Admin Mode** to return to Mission Mode
5. To locate the recently created mission, select the title of the
   mission in the drop down menu found in the top right corner, right of
   the Admin Mode selection
6. To set the appropriate time zone and language(s) for the mission,
   click the **Settings** menulocated on the main menu bar

       **Note:** To edit the name of a mission or to lock/unlock a
       mission after it has been created, Admin Mode must be activated.
       Once activated, click the Pencil icon (edit option) located to
       the right of the mission to be edited.
