NEMO/ELMO Documentation
=========================================

ELMO is The Carter Center’s open-source ELection MOnitoring data
collection and reporting system, built specifically with election
monitoring in mind. Equipped with ELMO, observers can submit evaluations
of a process – via tablets (utilizing Open Data Kit), SMS, or directly
online – in real-time to field or *mission* headquarters. ELMO’s
reporting system organizes observer findings, and is relied upon by The
Carter Center missions around the globe to analyze data and to assess
elections as well as broader political processes.

The open source license for ELMO is Apache 2.0. ELMO can be hosted on
personal servers and users can control who has access to the data.
